# Airbnb Berlin Listings Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of over 450,000 Airbnb listings in Berlin. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes extensive information on property characteristics, host details, and guest experiences. The primary goal is to uncover insights into the factors influencing customer satisfaction in the accommodation market.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Scikit-learn, TextBlob.

## Key Tasks and Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Addressing missing values, data cleaning, and normalization using techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizing NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment analysis and text processing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual data exploration and identifying trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applying machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict customer satisfaction metrics.
- **Model Optimization and Validation:** Using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for model evaluation.

## Results and Insights
The analysis provided valuable insights into the relationship between property characteristics, host information, and guest experiences. The machine learning models helped in predicting key factors that influence customer satisfaction, aiding in strategic decision-making for businesses in the accommodation sector.
